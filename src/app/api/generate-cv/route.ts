      - The summary should reflect the user's expertise, experience level, industries worked in, key strengths, and highlight professionalism and continuous learning.
      - If any startDate or graduationDate is missing or empty in education, set it to startDate: "Expected graduation:", graduationDate: "Upcoming"".
      - For any missing skill categories (languages, technical, softSkills), infer reasonable values based on the rest of the user's data.
      - For languages, infer the user's native language based on the language of the input data.
      - Each bullet point under experience must start with a **strong verb**, be achievement-oriented, and mention **quantifiable results or technologies/tools used** when possible.
      - Include **3-5 bullet points per job**.
      - If any other field is missing, infer reasonable placeholders based on similar profiles.
      - Be concise but informative.
